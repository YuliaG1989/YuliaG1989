### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yulia and I am a full stack developer. With 10 years of experience in hospitality, I have strong foundation in communication, ability to work in teams efficiently and have also learned how to lead one. I am well organized, very passionate about my field and a highly motivated person with attention to details.
